# Projector-based display

Below we provide materials for constructing a panoramic visual display using DLP projectors, which back-project images onto a screen made from a white diffuser sheet (V-H105-CV07 or V-HHDE-PM06-S01-D01 from BrightView Technologies, Durham, NC, USA).

Recommendations for projectors are listed [here].

It is possible to use the built-in illumination source for the projectors, or modify the projectors to use an external illumination source. Instructions for projector modifications can be found [here].
