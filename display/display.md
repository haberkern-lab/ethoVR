# Projector-based display

Below we provide materials for constructing a panoramic visual display using DLP projectors, which back-project images onto a screen made from a white diffuser sheet.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We use flat screens arranged in a regular pentagon shape with one side (behind the fly) open. The Janelia Unity Toolkit supports any pentagonal screen with one open face. This design does not require special brightness corrections for projections onto curved surfaces.

For the diffuser sheet, we recommend V-H105-CV07 or V-HHDE-PM06-S01-D01 from BrightView Technologies (Durham, NC, USA). Recommendations for projectors are listed [here].

It is possible to use the built-in illumination source for the projectors, or modify the projectors to use an external illumination source. Instructions for projector modifications can be found [here].
