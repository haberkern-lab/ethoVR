## Overview of the display design
Below are renderings of a pentagonal panoramic display with four projectors.
The projectors are mounted in a fixed position relative to the screen, such that alignment only needs to happen once (ideally). The full setup (screen + projectors) are mounted on a movable stage such that they can be moved out of the way to make the ball and fly easily accessible and give space to potential other rig components (e.g. a feeding station).

## Parts for the screen
**Commercial parts**
* 5x [thorlabs MS3R posts](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=MS3R)
*	10x [0.75in #4-40 flat head screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/91500A308/)
*	6x [0.1875in #4-40 flat head screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/91500A120/)

**3D printed parts**
*	2x 3d printed [screen holder](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/modelfiles/WIDE SCREEN HOLDER 2x.stl) parts with holes tapped for 4-40 thread
*	3x [screen assembly guide](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/modelfiles/SCREEN ASSEMBLY GUIDE.stl) (printed or lasercut and used during assembly only)
*	1x [Bottom Screen Support Frame](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/modelfiles/BOTTOM SCREEN SUPPORT FRAME.stl)
*	1x [Top Screen Support Frame](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/modelfiles/TOP SCREEN SUPPORT FRAME.stl)

**Lasercut parts**
*	1x [fly holder centering aid](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/modelfiles/CENTERFINDING JIG.stl): This helps with positioning the screen in a way that it is centered around the fly/ball holder.

**Screen material**
*	1x precut screen sheet with at least 1/8in extra height and 1in length to trim after assembly.

## Screen assembly
1. Assemble the wide screen holders and 2 thorlabs MSR3 posts with the 4-40 screws.
  ![step 1](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/screenAssembly_step1.png)
2. Re-enforce the assembly with the screen assembly guides (slip fit, no glue).
  ![step 2](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/screenAssembly_step2.png)
3. Pre-crease the screen and carefully to align it to the frame. Use superglue to adhere the centermost fold to the frame top and bottom being careful to maintain tension and alignment. Once dry, glue from the center out around the frame again. Be careful with the alignment to prevent bowing or wrinkles. Use binder clips to temporarily clamp the screen to the frame.
  ![step 3](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/screenAssembly_step3.png)
4. After everything has dried, remove the assembly guides, trim the screen flush top and bottom and screw this sub assembly into the Bottom Screen Support Frame with 3 #4-40 0.1875" screws.
  ![step 4](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/screenAssembly_step4.png)
5. Place the top screen support and remaining posts and screw down with remaining #4-40 screws (0.3125in into screen frame, 0.75in into the thorlabs posts.
