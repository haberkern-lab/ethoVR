2. Re-enforce the assembly with the screen assembly guides (slip fit, no glue).
  ![step 2](https://hjmh.github.io/ethoVR/assets/screenAssembly_step2.png)
3. Pre-crease the screen and carefully to align it to the frame. Use superglue to adhere the centermost fold to the frame top and bottom being careful to maintain tension and alignment. Once dry glue from the center out around the frame again being careful with alignment to prevent bowing or wrinkles. Clamping can be aided with binder clips.
