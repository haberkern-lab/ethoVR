This documentation is meant as a practical guide to help you set up your own Unity-based virtual reality using modules from the Janelia Unity Toolkit. In addition to "How-to guides", this website provides information to hardware, design files for custom 3D printed parts and assembly instructions.

A neuroscience project using this virtual reality system is described here: [Haberkern et al, bioRxiv, 2022](https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.17.492284v1.full).
