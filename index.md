## ethoVR

Documentation for a Unity-based virtual reality system for neurobiology and ethology applications.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Building on the Unity game engine, we developed a novel, versatile virtual reality software. We developed packages that extend Unity functionality in a modular manner to accommodate specialized needs for applications of virtual reality in neuroscience and (neuro-)ethology. These packages are published as part of the Janelia Unity Toolkit, and allow precise control of frame rate, setup of a panoramic display, a connection with FicTrac via socket connection, custom collision handling, data logging and more.

This documentation is meant as a practical guide for scientists to set up their own Unity-based virtual reality system using modules from the Janelia Unity Toolkit. In addition to "How-to guides" for the modular software, this website provides information to hardware, design files for custom 3D printed parts and assembly instructions.

A neuroscience project using this virtual reality system is described in [Haberkern et al, bioRxiv, 2022](https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.17.492284v1.full).
