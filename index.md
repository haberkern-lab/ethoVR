Documentation for a Unity-based virtual reality system for neurobiology and ethology applications.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This documentation is meant as a practical guide for scientists to set up their own Unity-based virtual reality system using modules from the Janelia Unity Toolkit. In addition to "How-to guides" for the modular software, this website provides information to hardware, design files for custom 3D printed parts and assembly instructions.


If you use tools described on this website, please reference the following manuscript:

The Janelia Unity Toolkit provides software packages that extend Unity functionality in a modular manner to accommodate specialized needs for applications of virtual reality to neuroscience and (neuro-)ethology. These packages allow precise control of frame rate, setup of a panoramic display, a connection with FicTrac via socket connection, custom collision handling, data logging and more. In addition, here we provide information on building hardware for a virtual reality system that permits neural recordings in behaving insects.
