## Tethering to a pin (for behavior or imaging experiments)

### Making a tether and tether holder
**For the tether itself:**

* [Adapter piece](https://www.microgroup.com/product-category/hypodermic_tubing/) between "tether foot" and tungsten wire: Stainless Steel 316 Hypodermic Tubing: 19 Gauge, 0.042" OD, 0.032" ID, 0.005" Wall, 12" Length
* Pin Contact Gold Crimp 20-24 AWG Machined (e.g. from Digikey, Catalog #: A2160-ND)
* [Tungston wire](http://www.a-msystems.com/p-728-tungsten-rod.aspx): 127 µm diameter, 3 in long, 100 pieces

**For a holder on which the tether can be mounted**

* Post that serves as [tether holder](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1257): Mini Series Mounting Posts, Ø6 mm, L = 3" (Product #: MS3R)
Possible alternative: 464 Brass Round Rod, Unpolished (Mill) Finish, H02 Temper, ASTM B21, 0.25" Diameter, 84" Length (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JP6DE0/ref=biss_dp_t_asn, Product #: 13440 )
Possible alternative: Eowpower 2pcs Brass Round Rods Lathe Bar Stock 1/4 Inch Diameter 14 Inch Length (https://www.amazon.com/Eowpower-Brass-Round-Diameter-Length/dp/B0748DQ1MP/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1504842092&sr=8-2&keywords=464+Brass+Round+Rod%2C, Product #: 02-001-015)
* Adapter piece, in which the tether can secured and which is to be mounted on the post: Socket Contact Gold Crimp 20-24 AWG Machined (from Digikey, Catalog #: A2161-ND)


### Tethering a fly
For gluing the tether to the thorax, we use KOA 300 (KEMXERT, York, PA, USA). In the second step, when we glue the head to the holder (which also fixes the head to the throax), we use a different UV curable glue: Fotoplast Gel from Dreve (Dreve Dentamid GmbH, Unna, Germany).
